How to cook Poached Egg
Make sure your eggs are really fresh.
Add a small dash of vinegar to a pan of steadily simmering water.
Crack eggs individually into a ramekin or cup.
Create a gentle whirlpool in the water to help the egg white wrap around the yolk.
Slowly tip the egg into the water, white first. Leave to cook for three minutes.
Remove with a slotted spoon, cutting off any wispy edges using the edge of the spoon.
Drain onto kitchen paper
